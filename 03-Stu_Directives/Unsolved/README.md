# Instructions

- Working with those around you, go through each file in `03-Stu_Directives/Unsolved` one-by-one and answer what each line with a `//` over it is doing.
- With each file, make sure you read up on that `Directive` in Vue's documentation (links are provided in each file)
- You should go through these in this order:
  1. v-bind.html
  2. v-if.html
  3. v-for.html
  4. v-on.html
- Don't rush through these, really take the time and ensure that you and those around you understand what is happening in each example. Even go as far as to edit the code and update it's logic to be something you create instead.
